Vehicle Types
=============

Teardown features a variety of drivable machinery:

**Industrial**
* **Excavator:** Use the arm to tear down buildings.
* **Front Loader:** Push debris and clear paths.
* **Crane:** Lift heavy objects or create high bridges.

**Transport**
* **Sports Cars:** Fast but fragile. Best for escape runs.
* **Trucks:** Good durability, can carry heavy targets.
* **Boats:** Essential for water-based escapes on maps like Hollowrock.

Handling & Physics
==================

Vehicles have realistic weight and tire physics.
* Heavy mud or water can bog down street vehicles.
* Destruction affects handling (e.g., losing a wheel).

Repairing
=========

You cannot repair vehicles during a mission. If a key vehicle is destroyed, you may need to restart or quick-load.
