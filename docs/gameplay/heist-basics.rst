The 60-Second Rule
==================

The core mechanic of Teardown's campaign is the 60-second timer.

1. **Planning Phase:** Unlimited time. Destroy walls, build bridges, and create your path.
2. **Trigger:** Stealing the first target triggers the alarm.
3. **Execution:** You have 60 seconds to grab remaining targets and reach the escape vehicle.

Types of Targets
================

* **Keycards:** Must be physically swiped.
* **Computers:** Require a few seconds to download.
* **Physic Objects:** Heavy items that must be carried or driven.

Tips for Success
================

* **Pre-clear Paths:** Remove windows, doors, and debris before starting.
* **Test Drives:** Drive your escape route to ensure vehicles don't get stuck.
* **Paint Spray:** Use paint to mark your intended path.
