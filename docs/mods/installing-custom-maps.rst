Steam Workshop (Recommended)
============================

The easiest way to get new maps is via the built-in Steam Workshop integration.

1. Open Teardown in your Steam Library.
2. Click on the **Workshop** tab.
3. Find a map you like and click **Subscribe**.
4. The map will appear in the "Mods" menu in-game.

Manual Installation
===================

If you downloaded a map from a third-party site:

1. Locate your Teardown documents folder (usually ``Documents/Teardown/mods``).
2. Create a new folder for the map.
3. Extract the downloaded files into this folder.
4. Enable the mod in the in-game menu.
