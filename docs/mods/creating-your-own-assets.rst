Getting Started
===============

Teardown uses the `.vox` format for its assets, which are created using **MagicaVoxel**.

1. Download [MagicaVoxel](https://ephtracy.github.io/).
2. Create your model using the voxel editor.
3. Save the file.

Importing to Teardown
=====================

Teardown includes a built-in editor for setting up scenes and defining object properties (like material type, weight, and flammability).

1. Enable "Dev Mode" in the game options.
2. Open the built-in editor.
3. Import your `.vox` models.

Scripting
=========

Advanced mods use Lua scripting to add custom behavior (like gun mechanics or vehicle logic). Refer to the official Teardown Modding API documentation for function references.
