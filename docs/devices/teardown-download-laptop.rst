Introduction
============

Playing Teardown on a laptop offers the flexibility of destruction on the go, but it comes with unique challenges due to the game's high performance demands. This guide covers how to **download Teardown for laptop** and optimize your portable setup for the best experience.

Performance on Laptops
======================

Teardown is a voxel-based game that heavily utilizes the CPU and GPU for physics calculations and ray tracing. Laptops, especially thin-and-light models, may struggle with heat and power delivery.

* **Cooling:** Ensure your laptop vents are not blocked. Use a cooling pad if possible.
* **Power:** Always play with your laptop plugged into a power source to ensure the GPU operates at maximum performance.
* **Battery:** Playing on battery will significantly reduce performance and playtime.

System Requirements for Laptops
===============================

Laptops generally require higher model numbers to match desktop performance.

* **GPU:** A discrete GPU (NVIDIA GTX 1060 Mobile / RTX 3050 Laptop GPU or better) is highly recommended. Integrated graphics are usually insufficient.
* **CPU:** A modern H-series processor (e.g., Intel Core i7-10750H or AMD Ryzen 7 5800H) handles the physics best.

Optimizing for Laptop Gameplay
==============================

To get smoother framerates on a laptop:

1. **Lower Resolution:** If you have a 4K screen, lower the game resolution to 1080p.
2. **Render Scale:** Adjust the render scale in the game settings to 75% or 50% if needed.
3. **Background Apps:** Close unnecessary applications to free up RAM and CPU resources.

Where to Download
=================

You can download Teardown for your laptop from the official Steam store.
