How to Download the Full Version
================================

To ensure you have the **latest Teardown update**, follow these steps to use the official delivery systems:

1. **Visit the Store:** Go to the `Teardown Steam Page <https://store.steampowered.com/app/1167630/Teardown/>`_.
2. **Select Ultimate Edition:** This ensures you don't have to buy DLCs separately later.
3. **Enable Auto-Updates:** In your Library, right-click *Teardown* > *Properties* > *Updates* > Set to "Always keep this game updated."
4. **Check Beta Branches:** For experimental features like the new Multiplayer, check the "Betas" tab in properties.

Verifying Your Version
======================

If you have already installed the game, you can verify if you have the **Teardown latest version** by checking the build number:

* **In-Game:** The version number is located in the bottom-right corner of the main menu.
* **File Integrity:** Use the "Verify Integrity of Game Files" tool in Steam to fix any corrupted assets after a major update.

.. tip::
   The 2026 update introduced **DirectX 12 support** as default. If you are running older hardware, you may need to switch to the "Legacy" branch in the Steam settings to maintain stability.

Why Avoid Unofficial "Full" Downloads?
======================================

Searching for a "Teardown full game free download" on third-party sites is risky for several reasons:

1. **No Multiplayer:** Official servers check for a valid Steam ID.
2. **Broken Mods:** Most Workshop mods require the latest API found only in the official version.
3. **Security:** Voxel engines require deep system access for physics; "cracked" versions often hide mining scripts or malware.
