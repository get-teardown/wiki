In-Game Settings
================

Adjust these settings for better performance:

* **Render Scale:** Lowering this to 75% or 50% significantly boosts FPS at the cost of sharpness.
* **Depth of Field:** Turning this off can save resources.
* **V-Sync:** Turn off if you want uncapped FPS, but turn on if you experience screen tearing.

Optimization Tips
=================

1. **Close Background Apps:** Browsers and recording software can eat up CPU cycles needed for physics.
2. **Update Drivers:** Ensure your GPU drivers are optimized for the latest OpenGL/Vulkan libraries used by Teardown.
3. **Limit Debris:** In Sandbox mode, massive amounts of loose debris will slow down the simulation. Use the "Clear Debris" option frequently.
